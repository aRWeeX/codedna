Tools available:

Strategy:

3. Trace the execution path: read the relevant files to understand how they work
4. Crucially: If a file defines dependencies or lists where it is used, EXPLORE those related files to ensure your fix is complete. A complete fix often requires changing test files, backend-specific files, or related utilities alongside the root cause.
5. Report: provide a comprehensive list of EVERY file you think needs modification, and what the fix should be.

Do not stop at finding just the first root cause. Make sure you map the full architectural boundary of the problem.
"""

CODEDNA_PROMPT = """## CodeDNA v0.8 — READ THIS FIRST

This codebase uses the CodeDNA annotation standard. These rules have the HIGHEST PRIORITY.
CodeDNA encodes architectural truth at 3 levels. Use them in order.

### Level 0 — `.codedna` manifest (provided in first message)
Already included above. Its `packages:` section gives each package's `purpose:` and `depends_on:`.
Use this to pick the correct package before reading any file. Do NOT re-read `.codedna` — you have it.

### Level 1 — module header (top of every `.py` file)
```
\"\"\"filename.py — <purpose>.

exports: public_symbol(args) -> type | none
used_by: consumer_file.py → consumer_symbol | none
rules:   <architectural constraints this file must obey>
agent:   <session narrative — skip this line, it's history>
\"\"\"
```

Read ONLY the first 20 lines of any file first. The header tells you whether to read the rest.
- `exports:` — public API symbols. If none match your task, STOP and move on.
- `used_by:` — who consumes this file. Tells you where the change cascades.
- `rules:` — hard constraints. If rules mention other files or backends, read those next.

### Level 2 — function `Rules:` docstring (inside functions)
```python
def my_function(arg: type) -> return_type:
    \"\"\"Short description.

    Rules:   What the agent MUST or MUST NOT do when modifying this function.
    message: <optional: open observations from previous agents>
    \"\"\"
```

When you read a file FULLY, scan every function docstring for a `Rules:` line. These are
per-function constraints that tell you:
- What invariants must hold when editing the function
- Which callers assume specific behaviour
- Edge cases and workarounds that must NOT be removed

**Respect `Rules:` in functions exactly like you respect `rules:` in module headers.**

---

## Navigation strategy

1. Start with the `.codedna` manifest to locate the RIGHT package.
2. Read the header of 1–3 candidate files (first 20 lines). Filter by `exports:` and `purpose:`.
3. If a file looks relevant: read fully, then check its `used_by:` graph.
   IMPORTANT: `used_by:` tells you WHO depends on this file — NOT that all of them need changes.
   For each caller, ask: "does this caller's domain intersect with the bug?" If not, skip it.
   Think: "which of these callers could be affected by THIS SPECIFIC change?"
4. If `related:` is present, check those files too — they share the same logic without importing
   each other (cross-cutting pattern). Same filter applies: is it relevant to THIS bug?
5. If `rules:` mentions a file/backend/package, read that immediately.
6. When inside a function, read its `Rules:` docstring BEFORE deciding what to change.
7. Before your final answer: verify every file you propose has had its `used_by:` and `rules:`
   checked, and every function you'd edit has its `Rules:` read.

"""

# Matched-control prompt: same length, same directive style, same strategy
# checklist as CODEDNA_PROMPT — but ZERO reliance on annotations. Purpose is
# to isolate the causal effect of CodeDNA annotations from the confounding
# effect of a longer/more-prescriptive prompt. Δ(codedna − matched_control) is
# the clean annotation effect.
MATCHED_CONTROL_PROMPT = """## Multi-file bug-localisation — READ THIS FIRST

You are navigating a Python codebase to find ALL files that must change for a complete
bug fix. These rules have the HIGHEST PRIORITY and must be followed in order.

### Level 0 — project root structure
Start by listing the root directory (`list_files(".")`) to understand the top-level layout.
The project organises code into packages (directories with `__init__.py`). Pick the package
whose name most closely matches the problem domain BEFORE reading any file.

### Level 1 — file header as filter
For any Python file you have not fully read: read only the first ~20 lines first.
- Find the class/function definitions declared near the top — these are the "exports".
- Decide whether the file's API surface intersects the problem. If not, STOP and move on.
- Only read a file fully when its top-of-file symbols match the problem domain.

### Level 2 — function signatures & existing docstrings
When reading a file fully, focus on:
- Public function/class signatures — do any change for the fix?
- Existing docstrings — they document invariants, edge cases, and constraints.
- Comments that describe WHY, not WHAT.
- Workarounds and edge-case branches (often the site of the bug).

Respect existing constraints. Don't propose changes that violate behavior other code relies on.

---

## Navigation strategy

1. Start with `list_files(".")` to locate the RIGHT package/directory for the problem.
2. Read the header of 1–3 candidate files (first 20 lines). Filter by declared symbols.
3. If a file looks relevant: read fully, then use `grep` to find its callers — every caller
   is a candidate for modification (especially cross-cutting fixes).
4. If the file mentions other files/backends/packages in docs or comments, read those next.
5. When inside a function, read its signature and docstring BEFORE deciding what to change.
6. Before your final answer: verify every file you propose has had its callers and
   constraints checked, and every function you'd edit has its signature read.
